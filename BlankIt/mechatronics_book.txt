The term embedded system is used where microprocessors are embedded into systems and it is this type of system we are generally concerned with in mechatronics. A microprocessor may be considered as being essentially a collection of logic gates and memory elements that are not wired up as individual components but whose logical functions are implemented by means of software. As an illustration of what is meant by a logic gate, we might want an output if input A AND input B are both giving on signals. This could be implemented by what is termed an AND logic gate. An OR logic gate would give an output when either input A OR input B is on. A microprocessor is thus concerned with looking at inputs to see if they are on or off, processing the results of such an interrogation according to how it is programmed, and then giving outputs which are either on or off.  For a microprocessor to be used in a control system, it needs additional chips to give memory for data storage and for input/output ports to enable it to process signals from and to the outside world. Microcontrollers are microprocessors with these extra facilities all integrated together on a single chip. An embedded system is a microprocessor-based system that is designed to control a range of functions and is not designed to be programmed by the end user in the same way that a computer is. Thus, with an embedded system, the user cannot change what the system does by adding or replacing software.
