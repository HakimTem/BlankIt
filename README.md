# BlankIt

# Inspiration
A few facts about quizzing:

Studies have shown that students who are tested regularly actually learn more content and retain it longer than students who have not been tested.
Frequent testing has also been shown to decrease test anxiety
To improve psychological readiness for mistakes
Especially in high school or university, students have to take many tests. As we are all first year university students, we understand the difficult transition and want to make it easier for everyone else in the future. This is why we are trying to help with the creation of an AI, study-enhancing online web service, that will not only personalize the questions to your own learning, but also to any course you are taking.

# What it does
This platform makes use of optical character recognition from Google Cloud Vision API by detecting text through text files and PDF files. This platform also utilizes Google Cloud's sentiment analysis tool to powerfully choose and analyze the most important words to blank out. This allows for students to access a personalized "fill in the blank" quiz sourced from their own notes.

# How we built it
This project has been built with many different components including:
Python3
Flask with bootstrap integration
Figma for UI Design
Google Cloud Services
Google AI Visioning
Google Storage
Sentiment Analysis
What we learned
Over the weekend, our team acknowledged the importance of collaboration to help brainstorm the necessary solutions to our product, as well as assigning tasks to each member to increase productivity. As well, our team gained experience with utilizing and maximizing Google Cloud Services and APIs.

# What's next for BlankIt
Our team plans to add these features to the product:

# Make a personal account for every user to store previous files and store previous fill in the blanks quizzes
Expand on the quizzes: make multiple choice quizzes, matching; tools to help retain information for info-heavy courses
Analyze text from images
We hope to inspire new hackers to develop applications that will help maximize the university experience by spending less time studying and more time on extracurriculars and social events!
