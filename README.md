# BlankIt
This platform makes use of optical character recognition from Google Cloud Vision API by detecting text through text files and PDF files. This platform also utilizes Google Cloud's sentiment analysis tool to powerfully choose and analyze the most important words to blank out. This allows for students to access a personalized "fill in the blank" quiz sourced from their own notes.
